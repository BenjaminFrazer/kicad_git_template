# Readme

This repository acts as a template for the Git aspects of base my personal KiCad projects. The aim is to consolidate the common and repetitive Git elements of a KiCad GitHub project such as:
- directory structure
- .gitignore
- library submodules (TODO)
- release scripts (TODO)

The internal structure of the KiCad project itself, will be left for the existing KiCad template tool.
